Uploading a new project to a new repository in Github:

(1) Log into Github, 
	select "Your Profile," 
	select "Repositories," 
	select "New," 
	insert name for repository (with NO spaces),
	be sure that "Initialize this repository with a README" is NOT checked, 
	and select "Create Repository."



(2) With your new repository page open, open Git (MAC) or Git Bash (WINDOWS).
git


(3) Navigate to your PROJECT FOLDER using the cd command (change directory). Your command should look something like this:

	cd desktop/codify/week0/myFirstSite

Once there, you can verify your location with "pwd" (print working directory) and with "ls" (lists contents of folder).



(4) Type "git init"

	(this initializes the ".git" folder in your project folder, linking it to Github)



(5) Type "git add ." 

	(this means "add everything in this folder")



(6) Type "git commit -m "first commit""

	(this labels this "commit" with a message, which usually is used to indicate the changes made which are now being pushed to Github, but since 	this is a NEW repository, "first commit" will do.)



(7) Type "git remote add origin "--followed by the github URL for the new repository. So your command should look something like this:

	git remote add origin https://github.com/evanw89/angularQuiz


(8) Type "git push origin master"


AND YOU'RE DONE! Refresh your repository page in browser and you should see your folder's files there.
